# ToDo App 
A machine with Xcode is required to compile and preview the app.
The purpose was to put multiple things learned from modules in SwiftUI into practice. 
This regards locationmanaging, persistence using SwiftData, PhotoPicking and more. 

A user can customize their profile picture, create ToDos using a list. It will also 
show the location of where they created this ToDo, as well as a timestamp.
